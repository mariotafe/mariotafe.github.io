<head> 
<title> favorites / bookmark title goes here </title>

<body bgcolor="white" text="blue">

<h1> My first page </h1>

This is my first web page and I can say anything I want in here - I do that by putting text or images in the body section - where I'm typing right now :) 

</body>

</html>
Notes: 
Most HTML tags require an 'opening' and 'closing'
A web page requires an opening and closing HTML tag i.e. <html> .. web page here.. </html>
The top section of the web page requires a 'head' section i.e. <head> ... </head>
Inside the 'head' you can place a title (which will be the name you see when you add the site to your favorites / bookmarks) i.e. <head> <title> ..text for favorites..</title></head>
After closing the <head>, the next section is the <body> In other words the body is inside the <html> and </html> but it's below the <head> ... </head> section.
Summary:
<html>
<head><title> ... favorites title ... </title></head>
<body>
.... all the web page is here ...
